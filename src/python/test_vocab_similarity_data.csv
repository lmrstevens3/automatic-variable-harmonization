The following variables were used to create the derived nutrient fields and should not be used by the end user and were therefore deleted from the final dataset: MEASURE1, MEASURE2, MEASURE3, FRACT1, FRACT2, and FRACT3. Only valid FFQ data is included in this dataset. Valid FFQ data is defined as FFQs with less than 13 blanks and calorie intakes between 600-4199 kcal for men and between 600-3199 kcal for women. Dietary intakes have been assessed repeatedly for the original cohort and for the Offspring cohort since 1989 using the Harvard semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) (Rimm et al. Am J Epidemiol 1992). The questionnaires were mailed to non-institutionalized participants before the examination and the participants were asked to bring the completed questionnaire with them to their appointment, at which time the FFQs were reviewed with the participant. The FFQ consists of a list of foods with a standard serving size and a selection of 9 frequency categories ranging from never or <1 serving/month to >= 6 servings/day.

Variables that have FFQ at the beginning of the variable description are those questions on the actual FFQ questionnaire and answered by the participant. Variables that are described as ""derived fields"" were calculated using the answers to the FFQ questions. Variables beginning with NUT_ are calculated as 'per day' nutrient values. The following variables were used to create the derived nutrient fields and should not be used by the end user and were therefore deleted from the final dataset: MEASURE1, MEASURE2, MEASURE3, FRACT1, FRACT2, and FRACT3. Only valid FFQ data is included in this dataset. Valid FFQ data is defined as FFQs with less than 13 blanks and calorie intakes between 600-4199 kcal for men and between 600-3199 kcal for women. Dietary intakes have been assessed repeatedly for the original cohort and for the Offspring cohort since 1989 using the Harvard semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) (Rimm et al. Am J Epidemiol 1992). The questionnaires were mailed to non-institutionalized participants before the examination and the participants were asked to bring the completed questionnaire with them to their appointment, at which time the FFQs were reviewed with the participant. The FFQ consists of a list of foods with a standard serving size and a selection of 9 frequency categories ranging from never or <1 serving/month to >= 6 servings/day.

High throughput metabolite profiling was performed on plasma specimens collected from individuals in the Framingham Offspring cohort attending Examination 5. This dataset includes measurements made on blood specimens (pre-OGTT) that were collected from a subset of the Offspring Cohort participants who attended Examination 5 (and were selected for inclusion in nested case-control studies of incident diabetes and cardiovascular disease). The concentration of plasma metabolites was assessed using a liquid chromatography / mass spectrometry (LC/MS) platform and HILIC method. In the dataset, each value represents the plasma concentration of an analyte (in this case, metabolite) that was assayed. This dataset represents the first ""installment"" of the Offspring Exam 5 assays. The balance of the Offspring Exam 5 assays will be processed at a later date (and therefore will reside in another dataset).

The Framingham Study began a postmortem brain tissue donation program in collaboration with the Boston University Alzheimer's Disease Center's Neuropathology Core in 1997. Participants are recruited through periodic newsletters, and using brochures and informational materials disseminated during neurology clinic, MRI and neuropsychological (NP) testing visits. Once enrolled, most participants are tested every 1-2 years, if required at their places of residence. As of end 2009 we had 35 Original cohort and 398 Offspring participants enrolled as potential brain donors. Half of the autopsy cases come from individuals who were clinically determined to be cognitively intact at the time of death. For participants whose brains come to autopsy, a post-mortem family interview is conducted with the closest next of kin and includes inquiries about changes in cognitive and functional status, and the time line associated with these changes. Questions from the Blessed Dementia Rating Scale, the Hachinski ischemic score and the Retrospective Clinical Dementia Rating Scale are embedded in the Family Interview questionnaire. Presence or absence of dementia and the type of dementia are determined based on clinical information alone, and the clinical diagnosis is shared with the neuropathologist at a clinico-pathological conference prior to which all pathological data and diagnoses have been independently recorded.",M19_L,"Inferior Parietal Region: Subcortical Deep White Matter:Neurofibrillary Tangles (Biel), left",Number of NFTs per field,No NFT's seen; Maximum density of 1 NFT per 20X field; Density of 2 - 5 NFTs per 20X field; Density of 6 - 9 NFTs per 20X field; Density of 10 or more NFTs per 20X field; Unknown,FHS,t_autbr_2011_m_0709s,n=69; nulls=70; No NFT's seen=0:count=47; Maximum density of 1 NFT per 20X field=1:count=8; Density of 2 - 5 NFTs per 20X field=2:count=7; Density of 10 or more NFTs per 20X field=4:count=6; Density of 6 - 9 NFTs per 20X field=3:count=1; Maximum density of 1 NFT per 20X field=1; Density of 2 - 5 NFTs per 20X field=2; Density of 6 - 9 NFTs per 20X field=3; Density of 10 or more NFTs per 20X field=4; Unknown=.,FHS239var5,phs000007.v26.pht002075.v4,,,"Original, Offspring"
